A tool to effectively calculate the Environmental Impact Score of the products

We propose a platform that calculates and displays an environmental impact score for products, based on a detailed life cycle analysis, various environmental factors such as greenhouse gas emissions, resource consumption, pollutant releases, and waste generation. This score will empower consumers to make environmentally conscious choices and encourage businesses to adopt more sustainable practices.

Introducing an innovative approach to quantifying the environmental footprint of food products, unlike anything currently available in the market.
